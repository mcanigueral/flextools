The smart charging concept is widely used in different fields and applications. In `flextools` package, we define *smart charging* as a tool to coordinate individual EV charging sessions in order to obtain the optimal aggregated demand profile according to a certain objective. There are different **scheduling methods** to coordinate each session, such as:

* **Postpone**: shifting charging start time over time
* **Interrupt**: stop charging during certain time
* **Curtail**: limiting charging power during certain time

At the same time, the charging sessions can be coordinated with different objectives or goals, such as minimizing the interaction with the power grid, minimizing the energy cost, participating in flexibility or imbalance markets, not surpassing grid constraints or capacity limits, accomplishing with demand-response programs, etc. 

The function `smart_charging()` aims to provide a framework to simulate any of these situations to analyze the impact and benefits of electric vehicle flexibility. 


# Smart charging algorithm

We have divided the smart charging algorithm contained inside `smart_charging()` function in two different stages:

1. Setpoint calculation for the aggregated EV demand curve
2. Scheduling of the individual sessions to match the setpoint of the aggregated demand

Below, we will briefly explain the process performed in each one of theses steps.


## Setpoint calculation

The *setpoint* for the aggregated EV demand is understood as the desired, optimal or allowed power demand, depending on the objective and characteristics of the control over the charging points. 

Currently, `flextools` allows the following methods to define the setpoint of the aggregated EV demand:

* Setpoint as **maxium EV demand**: a maximum EV demand capacity profile can be configured as a constrain to coordinate charging sessions below the limits. This must be set for every EV user profile in the charging sessions data set.

* Setpoint as **optimal EV demand**: the optinal EV demand is calculated based on a Quadratic programming optimization to minimize the interaction with the power grid (see [Net power optimization](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/minimize_net_power.html)), the energy cost (see [Energy cost optimization](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/minimize_cost.html)) or both (see [Combined optimization](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/combined_optimization.html)), setting the parameter `opt_objective` accordingly. Internally, the `smart_charging()` function is making use of the `optimize_demand()` function internally, using parameters `direction="forward"` to postpone EV sessions and `time_horizon=NULL` to exploit their flexibility until the end of the optimization window.  



## Scheduling algorithm

The scheduling method is defined by the parameter `method` in the `smart_charging()` function, which can be `"postpone"`, `"curtail"`, `"interrupt"` or `"none"`. If `method = "none"`, the sessions schedule is not modified and the calculated setpoints are returned as a optimal results. If `method` is different than `"none"`, after obtaining the setpoint $O_t$ (i.e. optimal load), the scheduling algorithm follows the sequence below for every time slot $t$:

1. Calculate $LF_t$, the EV demand (i.e. flexible load)
2. Get the time slots where $LF_t > O_t$
3. Stop if no more flexibility is required
4. For every time slot where $LF_t > O_t$

    4.1. Get the power difference between load and setpoint in the time slots where $LF_t > O_t$
    
    4.2. Select flexible sessions (see definition below) and set a priority order
    
    4.3. Go to next time slot if no more flexibility is available
    
    4.4. Coordinate flexible sessions to match the setpoint
    
5. Stop if no more flexibility is available
6. Return the new schedule of EV sessions

To classify a connected EV as a **flexible session** or not, the `flextools` package defines the following conditions according to smart charging method used:

* Postpone: the EV has not started charging yet, and the energy required can be charged during the rest of the connection time at the nominal charging power. From all flexible sessions in a time slot, the ones connecting earlier will have priority over the later sessions.
* Interrupt: the charge is not completed yet, and the energy required can be charged during the rest of the connection time at the nominal charging power. From all flexible sessions in a time slot, the ones that have been charging during less time will have priority over the sessions that have been already charging (rotation system).
* Curtail: the charge is not completed yet or will not be completed in the current time slot, and the energy required can be charged during the rest of the connection time at a lower power than the nominal charging power.

The energy and power constraints of these conditions can also be defined in function `smart_charging()` with the parameters `energy_min` and `charging_power_min`, representing the minimum allowed ratios of the nominal values. More information about using these parameters can be found in article [Advanced smart charging](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/smart-charging-advanced.html).



# Smart charging examples 

Below, some examples of `smart_charging()` are illustrated for both the **grid congestion simulation**, where we set a maximum EV capacity to not surpass, and the **optimization simulation**, where the net power usage or/and the energy cost are optimized thanks to smart charging.

For the smart charging examples that require optimizing the EV demand, a building demand, a solar PV production and energy prices are obtained from the example `energy_profiles` object provided by `flextools`:

```{r}
energy_data <- flextools::energy_profiles %>% 
  filter(isoweek(datetime) == 18, wday(datetime, week_start = 1) <= 5) %>% 
  mutate(
    solar = solar*4,
    building = building*2
  )
head(energy_data)
```


On top of these energy variables, we can simulate some charging sessions using the `evsim` package, which provides the function `evsim::get_custom_ev_model` to create a custom EV model to later simulate EV sessions with `evsim::simulate_sessions()` function.

We can create an EV model with custom time-cycles and user profiles. In this case, we will consider just one EV user profile (see the [EV user profile concept](https://mcanigueral.github.io/evprof/articles/evprof.html) from package `evprof`), "HomeEV", which will represent a "charge-at-home" pattern starting in average at 18:00 until next morning.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# For workdays time cycle
workdays_parameters <- dplyr::tibble(
  profile =  "HomeEV",
  ratio = 100,
  start_mean = 18,
  start_sd = 3,
  duration_mean = 13,
  duration_sd = 1,
  energy_mean = 15,
  energy_sd = 2
)

# For weekends time cycle
weekends_parameters <- dplyr::tibble(
  profile = "HomeEV",
  ratio = 100,
  start_mean = 12,
  start_sd = 2,
  duration_mean = 3,
  duration_sd = 2,
  energy_mean = 4,
  energy_sd = 1
)

parameters_lst <- list(workdays_parameters, weekends_parameters)

# Get the whole model
ev_model <- get_custom_ev_model(
  names = c("Workdays", "Weekends"),
  months_lst = list(1:12, 1:12),
  wdays_lst = list(1:5, 6:7),
  parameters_lst = parameters_lst,
  connection_log = FALSE,
  energy_log = FALSE,
  data_tz = "Europe/Amsterdam"
)
```

Once we have our own model, we simulate 5 sessions per day of our user profile called "HomeEV", charging at 3.7 kW, during the first 3 days of the `energy_data` and with a resolution of 15 minutes:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
set.seed(123)
ev_sessions <- simulate_sessions(
  evmodel = ev_model, 
  sessions_day = tibble(time_cycle = c("Workdays", "Weekends"), n_sessions = c(5, 5)),
  user_profiles = NULL,
  charging_powers = tibble(power = 3.7, ratio = 1), 
  dates = unique(date(energy_data$datetime))[1:3], 
  resolution = 15
) %>% 
  filter(Profile == "HomeEV")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ev_sessions <- readr::read_csv("sessions_smart_charging.csv") %>% 
  mutate_if(is.timepoint, with_tz, "Europe/Amsterdam")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ev_sessions %>% knitr::kable()
```


Finally we can calculate the time-series power demand from each EV with function `evsim::get_demand()`, using parameter `by="Sessions"`:

```{r}
ev_demand <- ev_sessions %>% 
  get_demand(by = "Session") 

ev_demand %>% 
  plot_ts(ylab = "Power demand (kW)", stackedGraph = T, fillGraph = T)
```


It is visible that these EV users tend to coincide during the evening peak hours while, if they were coordinated, they could make a more efficient usage of the power grid. Following, you will find some examples about how to coordinate these EV sessions using `smart_charging()` but first of all let's start with a minimal example. 

Let's simulate smart charging with:

* Optimization objective "grid" (minimizing interaction with the grid)
* Scheduling method "curtail" (reducing charging power when required)
* no contextual data for optimization (`opt_data` will be just a date time sequence)
* optimization window: starting at 6:00AM and with a length of 1 day (24h)

```{r}
sc_results <- smart_charging(
  ev_sessions, 
  opt_data = tibble(datetime = ev_demand$datetime, production = 0),
  opt_objective = "grid",
  method = "curtail",
  window_days = 1,
  window_start_hour = 6
)
```

The object returned by function `smart_charging()` is always list with 3 more objects:

```{r}
names(sc_results)
```

* **setpoints**: time-series data frame with the optimal setpoints of the EV demand
* **sessions**: coordinated EV sessions' data frame according to the setpoint
* **log**: list with messages about the smart charging algorithm (flexibility needs and availability, sessions modified, etc.). This is empty by default and filled with messages when `include_log = TRUE`.

Moreover, if we print the results we see a summary of the charging sessions that have been participating in the smart charging program, differentiating them between *Responsive*, *Flexible* and *Exploited*:

```{r}
print(sc_results)
```

* **Responsive**: charging sessions that accept to participate in the smart charging sessions. The ratio of responsive sessions from every EV user profile can be configured with the `responsive` parameter in the `smart_charging()` function. By default, all charging sessions are responsive.
* **Flexible**: charging sessions that are flexible in a specific time slot that requires flexibility. This depends on the session's features and the scheduling `method` (as described in the [Scheduling algorithm](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/smart_charging.html#scheduling-algorithm) section). If no flexibility is required, then this variable will be `FALSE` even if they could provide flexibility.
* **Exploited**: charging sessions that have been modified in the scope of the smart charging program. 

Also note that after applying the smart charging, the `sessions` object from the results has a lot more charging sessions. It is not the number of total charging sessions that has increased, but **all flexible sessions have been divided in multiple time slots**. This allows to modify the charging power of every time slot to 0 (postpone or interrupt methods) or between 0 and the nominal power (curtail method).

In the following example you can see how `Session` "S1" has a different `Power` value in different time slots:

```{r}
head(sc_results$sessions) %>% 
  knitr::kable(caption = "Coordinated charging sessions")
```

Then, the `setpoints` object from the result is a tibble that represents the objective EV demand and the power profile that the algorithm tried to match while scheduling the EV sessions:

```{r}
head(sc_results$setpoints)
```

We can visualise the setpoint on top to the EV demand to see how the optimal EV demand is different to the original demand:

```{r}
ev_demand %>% 
  left_join(
    rename(sc_results$setpoints, Setpoint = HomeEV),
    by = "datetime"
  ) %>% 
  plot_ts(ylab = "Power (kW)", legend_show = "onmouseover") %>% 
  dyStackedRibbonGroup(unique(ev_sessions$Session)) %>% 
  dySeries("Setpoint", color = "red", strokePattern = "dashed", strokeWidth = 2)
```

We can visualize the difference between the defined setpoint and the final EV user profile by applying the native `plot()` function to the `smart_charging()` results, which is equivalent to use the function `plot_smart_charging()`. Moreover, to see the difference between the flexible and the original EV demand, we can pass the `sessions` parameter to the `plot()` function.

```{r}
plot(sc_results, sessions = ev_sessions)
```

In this case, we see that at the end of the optimization window we have some peaks because the EVs have to charge their energy requirements before the end of the window. For methods to solve this issue see the section "The EV demand is pushed to the end of the optimization window" in the [Advanced smart charging](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/smart-charging-advanced.html) article.

Finally, the `log` object from the results is a list of strings containing all log messages from scheduling charging sessions for every timestamp and EV user profile. To enable the log messages it is required to configure the parameter `log = TRUE` in `smart_charging()` function.



## Grid capacity limit

Imagine that we have to charge the example EV charging sessions in an installation that has a **maximum grid connection of 8 kW**:

```{r}
grid_capacity <- 8
```

```{r}
ev_demand %>% 
  plot_ts(ylab = "Power demand (kW)", stackedGraph = T, fillGraph = T, legend_show = "onmouseover") %>% 
  dyLimit(grid_capacity, "Grid capacity", color = "red")
```

Since our peak goes above 18kW, we need to use smart charging to allow the EV users to charge under the grid capacity. In order to define a **grid capacity** in the `smart_charing()` function, a column with the same name than the EV user profile in the `sessions` parameter (in this example "HomeEV") must be found in the `opt_data` parameter. Therefore, a `"HomeEV"` column is added to the `opt_data` object as a setpoint for the EV user profile "HomeEV":

```{r}
opt_data <- tibble(
  datetime = ev_demand$datetime, # Same date-time sequence than the demand
  HomeEV = grid_capacity
)
head(opt_data)
```

Also, the parameter `opt_objective` must be set to `"none"` in order to skip optimization, since the setpoint for the smart charging algorithm will be given by the `opt_data` column named "HomeEV". 

Then, **which smart charging method should we use?** Let's compare them, considering optimization windows of 24 hours from 6:00AM to 6:00AM.


First we can try with the **postpone** strategy setting `method="postpone"`:

```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = "none",
    method = "postpone",
    window_days = 1, 
    window_start_hour = 6
  )
```

```{r}
ev_demand_opt <- sc_results$sessions %>% 
  get_demand(by = "Session") 
```

```{r}
ev_demand_opt %>% 
  plot_ts(ylab = "Power demand (kW)", stackedGraph = T, fillGraph = T, legend_width = 150) %>% 
  dyLimit(grid_capacity, "Grid capacity", color = "red") %>% 
  dyAxis("y", valueRange = c(0, 10))
```

We see that the later EV sessions have been shifted during the night instead of start charging right at the connection time during peak hours. This is not a problem if all EVs are completely charged during their connection times, but it may suppose a risk for the late EV connections that have to wait until all previous sessions have been charged. This issue is solved with the **interrupt** strategy, where a rotation system is designed to charge a similar amount of energy to all connected EVs.

Let's see the difference with `method="interrupt"`:

```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = "none",
    method = "interrupt",
    window_days = 1, 
    window_start_hour = 6
  )
```

```{r}
ev_demand_opt <- sc_results$sessions %>% 
  get_demand(by = "Session") 
```

```{r}
ev_demand_opt %>% 
  plot_ts(ylab = "Power demand (kW)", stackedGraph = T, fillGraph = T, legend_width = 150) %>% 
  dyLimit(grid_capacity, "Grid capacity", color = "red") %>% 
  dyAxis("y", valueRange = c(0, 10))
```

Now we see the same aggregated result but we also see that the individual sessions are interrupted to enable new sessions to charge, for a better equality among EV users. However, both postpone and interrupt methods do not provide high flexibility in terms of power since the individual charging power can't be reduced. In that sense, the **curtail** method provides a higher flexibility potential to adapt the EV demand to more variable or fluctuating signals such as flexibility markets or energy prices. 

Let's see the difference with `method="curtail"`:

```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = "none",
    method = "curtail",
    window_days = 1, 
    window_start_hour = 6
  )
```

```{r}
ev_demand_opt <- sc_results$sessions %>% 
  get_demand(by = "Session") 
```

```{r}
ev_demand_opt %>% 
  plot_ts(ylab = "Power demand (kW)", stackedGraph = T, fillGraph = T, legend_width = 150) %>% 
  dyLimit(grid_capacity, "Grid capacity", color = "red") %>% 
  dyAxis("y", valueRange = c(0, 10))
```

Now we see that the EV demand is completely adapted to the grid capacity, sharing the full capacity among all different charging EVs in equal parts.


<!-- Imagine now that the **maximum grid connection has to be reduced to 4 kW**, so that we can charge only one EV at a time: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- grid_capacity <- 4 -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- In this highly restricted scenario, applying any one of the previous smart charging methods is resulting in power profile that surpasses the grid capacity: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=F} -->

<!-- The demand is being postponed by the smart charging algorithm to match the setpoint during all possible hours, but when the end of the optimization window is reaching, the vehicle must charge to accomplish with the energy required by the EV user. This means that all EV users are not able to charge all their requirements under these grid conditions.  -->

<!-- There may be some scenarios where the charging point operator can assume this kind of impact to the user in order to mantain grid stability, so we can also consider that is not mandatory to fill the batteries of all vehicles. This can be configured with the parameter `energy_min`, as the required minimum ratio of the energy required by the EV user. Let's try a value of `energy_min = 0` to see how the algorithm works and the corresponding impact to the vehicles: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo = FALSE} -->
<!-- energy_min <- 0 -->
<!-- sc_results <- map( -->
<!--   set_names(c("postpone", "interrupt", "curtail")), -->
<!--   ~ ev_sessions %>%  -->

<!--       energy_min = energy_min -->
<!--     ) -->
<!-- ) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- ev_demand %>%  -->
<!--   aggregate_timeseries("original") %>%  -->
<!--   mutate( -->
<!--     postpone =  sc_results$postpone$sessions %>%  -->
<!--       get_demand() %>% .[[2]], -->
<!--     interrupt = sc_results$interrupt$sessions %>%  -->
<!--       get_demand() %>% .[[2]], -->
<!--     curtail =  sc_results$curtail$sessions %>%  -->
<!--       get_demand() %>% .[[2]], -->
<!--   ) %>%  -->
<!--   plot_ts(ylab = "Power demand (kW)", stackedGraph = F, fillGraph = T, legend_width = 150, strokeWidth = 2) %>%  -->
<!--   dySeries("original", color = "gray", strokePattern = "dashed", fillGraph = F) %>%  -->
<!--   dyLimit(grid_capacity, "Grid capacity", color = "red") -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- Now we see that the grid capacity constraint is respected, **but at which price?** -->

<!-- Let's see the impact on the EV user in terms of **percentage of energy charged**: -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- sc_results$postpone$sessions %>% -->

<!--   select(Session, Postpone = EnergyCharged) %>%  -->
<!--   left_join( -->
<!--     sc_results$interrupt$sessions %>% -->
<!--       group_by(Session) %>% summarise(Energy = sum(Energy)) %>%  -->
<!--       left_join(ev_sessions %>% select(Session, EnergyRequired = Energy), by = "Session") %>%  -->
<!--       mutate(EnergyCharged = round(Energy/EnergyRequired*100)) %>%  -->
<!--       select(Session, Interrupt = EnergyCharged), -->
<!--     by = "Session" -->
<!--   ) %>%  -->
<!--   left_join( -->
<!--     sc_results$curtail$sessions %>% -->
<!--       group_by(Session) %>% summarise(Energy = sum(Energy)) %>%  -->
<!--       left_join(ev_sessions %>% select(Session, EnergyRequired = Energy), by = "Session") %>%  -->
<!--       mutate(EnergyCharged = round(Energy/EnergyRequired*100)) %>%  -->
<!--       select(Session, Curtail = EnergyCharged), -->

<!--   ) %>%  -->
<!--   bind_rows( -->

<!--   ) %>%  -->
<!--   knitr::kable(caption = "Percentage of energy charged (%)") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- We see that the curtail strategy is the one with lowest average impact on the users, in contrast to postpone which has the highest impact, specially in late charging sessions. Therefore, we can say that, if we want the EV users to charge at least 50% of their energy requirements, the only suitable strategies are curtail and interrupt. -->


## Net power optimization

Imagine the EV charging sessions from our examples in a building that has it own demand profile and PV production. We can use the example data set from `energy_data` to visualize it:

```{r}
ev_demand <- get_demand(ev_sessions)
```

```{r}
energy_data %>% 
  left_join(ev_demand, by = "datetime") %>% 
  select(-starts_with("price")) %>% 
  plot_ts(ylab = "Power (kW)", strokeWidth = 2) %>% 
  dySeries("solar", "PV production", "orange") %>% 
  dyStackedRibbonGroup(c("HomeEV","building"), color = c("purple", "navy"))
```

We see that the EV demand cause an even higher demand peak during the evening peak hours. To solve this issue, the EV sessions can be coordinated with the building demand profile to obtain a lower aggregated peak. This can be done with function `smart_charging()`, using a net power optimization (i.e. `opt_objective = "grid"`, see more information in [Net power optimization article](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/minimize_net_power.html). We will simulate it using a `"curtail"` method, considering optimization windows of 24 hours from 6:00AM to 6:00AM, and renaming the variable `"solar"` to `"production"` and `"building"` to `"static"` in the `opt_data` object:

```{r}
opt_data <- energy_data %>% 
  rename(production = solar, static = building)
```


```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = "grid",
    method = "curtail",
    window_days = 1, 
    window_start_hour = 6
  )
```

```{r}
plot(sc_results, sessions = ev_sessions)
```

We see that the EVs in this case could match the setpoint during most of the time. The optimal setpoint is a specific power curve calculated to obtain the flattest possible net power curve. We can check that by adding the flexible EV profiles to the building (`consumption = building + HomeEV`) and visualizing the net power profile with function `plot_net_power()`, which calculates the net power from columns `consumption` and `production`.

```{r}
ev_demand_flex <- sc_results$sessions %>% 
  get_demand() 

df_flex <- energy_data %>% 
  select(datetime, building, solar) %>% 
  left_join(
    ev_demand_flex, by = "datetime"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    consumption = building + HomeEV,
    production = solar
  )

plot_net_power(df_flex)
```

From this graph we see that during the evening peak, the demand can be completely flat, shaving the peak, if the EVs can be coordinated to match the setpoint. We can also compare the net power profile from the static and flexible case with the parameter `original_df`. In this plot we clearly see the added value of EV flexibility to reduce the impact to the grid during the evening peak.

```{r}
df_static <- energy_data %>% 
  select(datetime, building, solar) %>% 
  left_join(
    ev_demand, by = "datetime"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    consumption = building + HomeEV,
    production = solar
  )

plot_net_power(df_flex, original_df = df_static)
```

However, we see that during some timeslots the EV demand surpasses the setpoint. This happens in order to charge all energy requirements for all EVs, since by default `energy_min = 1`. If we set `energy_min = 0.5`, we see that we can meet the setpoint to all time slots but not all energy required is charged to the vehicles.

```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = "grid",

<!-- Making zoom at a single day, for example the evening of 2nd May, we can see that the *postpone* strategy can't fully shift the power peak from peak hours, since all sessions that have already started charging are not flexible. On the other hand, *interrupt* and *curtail* strategies are better in peak shaving since more EV sessions are candidates to provide flexibility.  -->

<!-- At the same time, the *interrupt* method limits EV charging below setpoint since it can only stop sessions. This results in a lack of flexibility at the end of the optimization window and a rebound effect since the sessions must charge before the end of connection time. -->

<!-- Finally, even though all sessions have been coordinated in a different way, the total energy consumed by all EV users must remain the same: -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- sum(ev_sessions$Energy) -->
<!-- sum(sc_results$postpone$sessions$Energy) -->
<!-- sum(sc_results$interrupt$sessions$Energy) -->
<!-- sum(sc_results$curtail$sessions$Energy) -->
<!-- ``` -->

## Energy cost optimization

As we have seen, the EV demand from our "HomeEV" user profile occur mainly during evening peak hours, which is a problem for grid congestion but also for the EV user since they are also the most expensive hours (with dynamic tariffs):

```{r}
energy_data %>% 
  select(
    datetime, solar, building, price_imported, price_exported
  ) %>% 
  left_join(ev_demand, by = "datetime") %>% 
  plot_ts(strokeWidth = 2) %>% 
  dyAxis("y", "Power (kW)") %>% 
  dyAxis("y2", "Price (€/kWh)") %>% 
  dyStackedRibbonGroup(c("HomeEV","building"), color = c("purple", "navy")) %>% 
  dySeries("solar", "PV production", "orange") %>% 
  dySeries("price_imported", "Imported energy price", axis = "y2", color = "red", strokePattern = "dashed") %>% 
  dySeries("price_exported","Exported energy price",  axis = "y2", color = "green", strokePattern = "dashed")
```


The energy cost can be optimized with function `smart_charging()`, using energy cost optimization (i.e. `opt_objective = "cost"`, see more information in [Energy cost optimization article](https://mcanigueral.github.io/flextools/articles/minimize_net_power.html). We will simulate it using a `"curtail"` method, considering optimization windows of 24 hours from 6:00AM to 6:00AM, and renaming the variable `"solar"` to `"production"` and `"building"` to `"static"` in the `opt_data` object, and keeping the `price_imported` and `price_exported` variables:

```{r}
opt_data <- energy_data %>% 
  select(
    datetime, production = solar, static = building, 
    price_imported, price_exported
  )
head(opt_data)
```


```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = "cost",
    method = "curtail",
    window_days = 1, 
    window_start_hour = 6
  )
plot(sc_results)
```

In this case the setpoint gets very high values when the `price_imported` variable has low values. We have 2 options to solve that:

1. Use a `lambda` value
2. Use a combined optimization

In this case we will use a combined optimization, setting the parameter `opt_objective = 0.1` meaning 90% cost minimization and 10% net power minimization:

```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = 0.1,
    method = "curtail",
    window_days = 1, 
    window_start_hour = 6
  )
plot(sc_results, sessions = ev_sessions)
```

We can visualize the difference on the energy cost thanks to the optimization using function `plot_energy_cost()`. This function requires a data frame with the total `consumption` and `production`, as well as the `price_imported` and `price_exported` variables. Moreover, we can compare the static and flexible cases by using the `original_df` parameter.

```{r}
ev_demand_flex <- sc_results$sessions %>% 
  get_demand() 

df_flex <- energy_data %>% 
  select(datetime, building, solar, price_imported, price_exported) %>% 
  left_join(
    ev_demand_flex, by = "datetime"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    consumption = building + HomeEV,
    production = solar
  )

df_static <- energy_data %>% 
  select(datetime, building, solar, price_imported, price_exported) %>% 
  left_join(
    ev_demand, by = "datetime"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    consumption = building + HomeEV,
    production = solar
  )

plot_net_power(df_flex, original_df = df_static)
```

From this graph we see that the demand has been shifted from the evening peak to the night valley, looking for cheaper hours. We can check the difference in the total energy cost by using `get_energy_total_cost()` function:

* Total energy cost of **static scenario**:

```{r}
get_energy_total_cost(df = df_static)
```

* Total energy cost of **flexible scenario**:

```{r}
get_energy_total_cost(df = df_flex)
```


## Energy cost with grid constraints

Even though we can talk about two different objectives, there could be a situation where we want to minimize the energy cost under certain grid constraints. In these cases, the optimization objective should be "cost" as well, but we can make use of the `grid_capacity` variable configurable in the `opt_data` parameter from `smart_charging()` function. 

The `grid_capacity` variable in the `opt_data` tibble represents the maximum consumption, not only for the EV demand but also the rest of static demand (`consumption = building + EV`):

```{r}
df_static <- energy_data %>% 
  left_join(ev_demand, by = "datetime") %>% 
  mutate(
    consumption = building + HomeEV,
    production = solar
  )
```

```{r}
plot_net_power(df_static)
```

So let's assume that for the current demand we have a **grid capacity of 10 kW**. We can visualize with the `import_capacity` parameter in the `plot_net_power()` function to see if the net power surpasses the grid capacity:


```{r}
plot_net_power(df_static, import_capacity = 10)
```

Then we can perform a cost optimization with the parameter `opt_objective = 0.1` meaning 90% cost minimization and 10% net power minimization. For that, we will also include the `grid_capacity` variable in the `opt_data` object:

```{r}
opt_data <- energy_data %>% 
  select(
    datetime, production = solar, static = building, 
    price_imported, price_exported
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    grid_capacity = 10
  )
head(opt_data)
```

```{r}
sc_results <- ev_sessions %>% 
  smart_charging(
    opt_data = opt_data, 
    opt_objective = 0.1,
    method = "curtail",
    window_days = 1, 
    window_start_hour = 6
  )
```

```{r}
df_flex <- energy_data %>% 
  left_join(sc_results$setpoints, by = "datetime") %>% 
  mutate(
    consumption = building + HomeEV,
    production = solar
  )
```

```{r}
plot_net_power(df_flex, original_df = df_static)
```

Now we see that our total consumption remains below the limits of our grid capacity. **But is the cost being optimized?**


```{r}
plot_energy_cost(df_flex, original_df = df_static)
```

It seems that we consume more during valley hours (night) than during peak hours (evening), so the cost could be still decreased. We can check the difference in the total energy cost by using `get_energy_total_cost()` function:

* Total energy cost of **static scenario**:

```{r}
get_energy_total_cost(df = df_static)
```

* Total energy cost of **flexible scenario**:

```{r}
get_energy_total_cost(df = df_flex)
```

In this case, **the cost optimization is not possible if the grid is constrained**.
