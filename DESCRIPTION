Description: This package provides the necessary tools to simulate demand-response scenarios regarding
	electric vehicles flexibility or a stationary battery. The EV sessions coordination algorithm 
	is based on the user profile concept raised by package {evprof}.
	This package depends on Python optimization package CVXOPT to handle the quadratic optimizations.
