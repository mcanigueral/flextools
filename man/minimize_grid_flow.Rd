\usage{
minimize_grid_flow(
  G,
  LF,
  LS = NULL,
  direction = "forward",
  time_horizon = NULL,
  window_length = NULL,
  flex_window_length = window_length,
  LFmax = Inf,
  grid_capacity = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{G}{numeric vector, being the renewable generation profile}

\item{LF}{numeric vector, being the flexible load profile}

\item{LS}{numeric vector, being the static load profile}

\item{direction}{character, being \code{forward} or \code{backward}. The direction where energy can be shifted}

\item{time_horizon}{integer, maximum number of positions to shift energy from.
If \code{NULL}, the \code{time_horizon} will be the length of \code{G}, \code{LF}, and \code{LS} (it must be the same)}

\item{window_length}{integer, window length in time slots (not hours).
If \code{NULL}, the \code{window_length} will be the length of \code{G}, \code{LF}, and \code{LS} (it must be the same)
It can also be an integer vector, specifying a specific length for every
window along the length of \code{G}. In that case, the sum of all vector values
must be equal to the length of \code{G}.}

\item{flex_window_length}{integer, flexibility window length in time slots (not hours).
This optional feature lets you apply flexibility only during few hours from the start of the window.}

\item{LFmax}{numeric, value of maximum power (in kW) of the flexible load \code{LF}}

\item{grid_capacity}{numeric or numeric vector, grid maximum power capacity that will limit the maximum optimized demand}
