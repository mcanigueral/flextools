## Overview

`flextools` package provides functions for:

* Optimizing time-series power loads for minimizing net power interaction with the grid or energy cost
* Smart charging simulation considering different methods to coordinate charging sessions, such as postpone, curtail or interrupt
* Simulation of battery systems for optimization purposes or just business-as-usual battery behavior


## Usage

If you want to test `flextools` with your own data set of time-series energy, the best place to start is the [Get started chapter](https://resourcefully-dev.github.io/flextools/articles/flextools.html) in the package website.


## Installation

Since at this moment flextools is not yet in CRAN, you can install the the latest development version from GitHub:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("resourcefully-dev/flextools")
```


## Getting help

If you encounter a clear bug, please open an issue with a minimal reproducible example on [GitHub](https://github.com/resourcefully-dev/flextools/issues).
